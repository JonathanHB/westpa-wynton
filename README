### INPUT DATA ###
- Add gromacs input files, such as from charmm-gui. These MUST be named the following:
  - 'index.ndx': index file
  - 'input.gro': structure  
  - 'topol.top': topology file for the system
  - 'toppar/': directory of other referenced topology files
  - 'md.mdp': sim parameter file for gromacs 

### WESTPA CONFIG ###
- In 'bstates/pcoord.init', write the initial pcoord for the starting structure
- In 'west.cfg', we'll add run options:
  - under 'west/system/system_options', set 'pcoord_ndim', 'pcoord_len', and 'pcoord_dtype' to the correct values.
  - also set 'boundaries' to a python list of the edges of the pcoord boxes, including the outermost edges (or, put 'inf' or '-inf' for the first or final box to extend to infinity)
  - under 'west/system/?', set 'bin_target_counts' to the number of desired walkers per bin.
  -  also set 'max_total_iterations' to the total number of iterations you want WESTPA to run.
- 'westpa_scripts/runseg.sh' will run each iteration and call 'westpa_scripts/calc_pcoord.py' to calculate the pcoord of each walker at the end of its iteration. You will likely need to modify 'westpa_scripts/calc_pcoord.py' to return your desired pcoord.

### COMPUTE RESOURCES ###
- To change how many GPU nodes (or CPUs per GPU node) are run, edit the values in 'run_zmq.sh'
  - in the header section, the line '#$ -t 1-10' specifies the number of simultaneous nodes that will run. 
  - The line 'GMX_CPUS=8' specifies the number of CPUs requested per GPU
  - Im pretty sure this is non-optimal, so someone who knows more than me should look at 'run_zmq.sh' and 'westpa_scripts/runseg.sh' to do this better.
 
### Initialize and run ###
- make sure you're using the Wynton conda module and westpa-2.0 conda environment:
  - instructions for this is in the 'conda_env/' directory
- run WESTPA initialization:
  - './init.sh'
- Then, run WESTPA with:
  - './run_chain.sh -r run_zmq.sh -n 200' where -n specifies the number of sequential Wynton jobs.
  - This works by calling run_chain.sh, which will link many Wynton jobs together one after the other. Because Wynton kicks a user off of a GPU after 2 hours, this will automatically resume the WESTPA run.
  - Note: the -n flag for number of WESTPA jobs is NOT the same as the number of WESTPA iterations.
  - Each wynton job calls 'run_zmq.sh', which creates several sub-jobs as specified in that script.
  - This way, each iteration is run parallelized, and all iterations run automatically regardless of the GPU time limit on Wynton.
- when restarting after a walker crashes
  - remove everything older than the last round in which the walkers all ran successfully
  - remove the rounds of west.h5 for which walkers crashed (there's a command for this)
